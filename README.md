# Sales-and-Customer-Dashboards-Dynamic-
Executive Summary:

This project showcases the development of two dynamic Tableau dashboards—Sales and Customer—aimed at addressing the business problem of underperforming product categories and fluctuating customer engagement. Leveraging skills in data visualization, KPI analysis, and trend identification, the dashboards provide actionable insights.
Key recommendations include focusing on high-margin products, addressing the sudden profit drop, and improving customer retention strategies.

Business Problem:

The company is facing significant challenges with underperforming product subcategories, inconsistent profit margins, and an over-reliance on a small group of high-value customers. Despite generating substantial sales, certain product lines are not yielding expected profits, and customer retention strategies appear ineffective. The business needs a strategic overhaul to improve profitability, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer loyalty.

Objective:

The key goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of sales and customer performance by focusing on year-over-year trends, sales, profits, customer behavior, and top-performing products. This was achieved by creating calculated fields and insightful visualizations, offering actionable insights for business growth.

What Was Accomplished:

Sales Dashboard:

Summarized total sales, profit, and quantity performance for the current and previous year.

Highlighted trends across months, showing the highest and lowest sales, and tracked changes over time.

Compared product subcategories for both sales and profit, revealing critical insights into product performance.

Visualized weekly sales and profit data to identify patterns and deviations from average performance.

Customer Dashboard:

Presented a KPI overview of total customers, sales per customer, and orders for the year.

Examined customer distribution by order volume, identifying loyal and high-value customers.

Showcased the top 10 customers by profit, providing actionable data to improve customer retention strategies.

Skills Demonstrated:

1. Data Visualization: Created interactive, insightful, and visually appealing dashboards to aid in business decision-making.
2. Calculated Fields: Used Tableau’s calculated fields for accurate metrics like YoY performance and average sales.
3. Business Impact: Uncovered crucial business insights, such as identifying underperforming products, high-profit customers, and trends that may need intervention (e.g., sudden profit drops in April).
4. Strategic Recommendations: Provided data-driven recommendations to optimize sales and improve customer loyalty based on insights derived from the dashboards.

Recommendations:
1. Focus on optimizing products that have consistent sales but low profit, such as phones.
2. Investigate why certain subcategories, like tables and machines, are underperforming and consider strategic pivots.
3. Develop a stronger focus on retaining high-value customers by analyzing top customer behavior patterns.
